    "* Make sure to put your name in the body of the notebook, and in the filename.\n",
    "* You may discuss these problems with other students in class, but you must turn in your own notebook.\n",
    "* List anyone with whom you discussed the work.\n",
    "* Please document your code, label your plots, and use markdown cells to add explanatory comments to the notebook. Remember to reflect on how you can be confident that your code is correct.\n",
    "* Feel free to leave specific questions for me in your notebook.\n",
    "* If you resubmit your work, clearly state what is new (within the notebook or as a Canvas comment) so I can evaluate the changes.\n",
    "* Save your notebook as a pdf file and submit it in Canvas before the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may not distribute this notebook beyond our class, or post it anywhere online, without permission from the instructor.\n",

    "### Specific instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal here is to practice working with python and numpy commands: loops, lists, arrays, slicing, etc. Here are the specific tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a list containing the first five odd numbers. Do this three ways: (i) by hand, (ii) using a for loop, and (iii) using list comprehension. Then extract the *first* three elements of the list, and the *last* three elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a 2-d list in which each element contains an integer and a letter. The integer should loop over (0,1,2) while the letter should loop over (a,b,c). Does the order of loops matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate an array containing integers from to 0 to 14, then find an automated way to change the sign of all the multiples of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a function to determine whether an integer is prime. Then check all integers from 1 to 20 and separate them into a list of primes and a list of numbers that are not prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a column matrix with $i$ in the first column, $i^2$ in the second column, and $i^3$ in the third column, for $i$ from 1 to 7. To practice working with files, write your matrix to a file and read it back in. Do all of this using *only* numpy commands (i.e., do *not* explicitly write any for loops)."
