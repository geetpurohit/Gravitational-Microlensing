# Overview
In gravitational microlensing, a star temporarily brightens when its light is focused by the gravitational field of another star that happens to be passing in front (from our perspective). Here is an example of Gravtitational Microlensing:

# Data 
The OGLE project (Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment) (Links to an external site.) provides an extensive database of microlensing events. That page lists events from 2019, and provides links to events from prior years. Here is a figure from the OGLE website that is typical for this kind of analysis:

# Model
The basic model is known as the Paczynski light curve, and it describes a simple scenario with a single "lens" star in the foreground and a single "source" star in the background. In this model, the lens is treated as a point mass and the source is treated as a point source. Many observed microlensing events are well fit by the Paczynski light curve, but some have additional complications.


# Goal
In this project, I will fit microlensing models to observed light curves (brightness vs. time) in order to extract key parameters for microlensing events. I will pick three microlensing events from the OGLE database and fit them with the Paczynski light curve. In my paper and presentation, I will explain how I chose the events and obtained the data. For each event, I report the best-fit values of the model parameters, and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to characterize the uncertainties.
